The files in this directory contain problematic syntax.
These files are the data for the BugFixTests.java unit tests.
It just runs the tree parsers against this directory.
If no exceptions are thrown, then the tests pass.
The files in this directory are subject to change, so no other
tests should be added other than the expectation that they parse clean.
